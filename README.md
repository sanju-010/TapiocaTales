# TapiocaTales

TapiocaTales is a food booking and self-service application designed for cafés and small restaurants. Built with .NET (backend) and Angular (frontend), it allows customers to browse dishes, place orders, and pre-book their meals directly from their devices — eliminating long queues and improving the overall dining experience.
